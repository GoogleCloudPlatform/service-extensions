# Quick start 

This server requires the `grpcio` and `grpcio-tools` python packages.


The prefered method of installation is with a virtual enviornment through `venv`. To set up the virtual enviornment run:
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin activate
```
Then the packages can be installed with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And if you want to run tests:
```
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Without `venv`

Alternatively, the packages can be installed through the package manager:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-grpcio -y
```

## Running
The server can then be started from the `callouts/python` directory or from the install location with:

```
python service_callout.py
```

The server will then run until interupted, for example, by inputing `Ctrl-C`. 

# Tests

Tests can be run with:
```
pytest test_server.py
```

# TODO
- Split out the server into two files so that grpc packages are not needed when just using the HTTP version of the server.
