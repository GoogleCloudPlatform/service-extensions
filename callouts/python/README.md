# Quick start 

This server requires the `grpcio` and `grpcio-tools` python packages.


The prefered method of installation is with a virtual enviornment through `venv`. To set up the virtual enviornment run:
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin activate
```
Then the packages can be installed with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And if you want to run tests:
```
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Without `venv`

Alternatively, the packages can be installed through the package manager:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-grpcio -y
```

## Running
Example servers can be started from the `extproc/example/<...>` directories. 
The `service_callout_example` server can be started with:

```
python -m extproc.example.grpc.service_callout_example
```

The server will then run until interupted, for example, by inputing `Ctrl-C`. 

# Tests

Tests can be run with:
```
pytest
```

# Building Docker

To build the example docker images call `docker build -f` with a path to the example Dockerfile from this directory:
```
docker build -f ./extproc/example/grpc/Dockerfile -t service-callout-example-python .
```

And to run the image:

```
docker run --network host -P service-callout-example
```

Using the `-P` flag tells the docker to connect the exposed ports to the local machine's ports. Additionally, setting `--network host` tells docker to connect the image to the `0.0.0.0` or `localhost` ip address.
